Version 1.3.1 (unreleased)
--------------
* Added "assets" to the script bindings so that model scripts can load
    model-relative assets. Useful for swapping/flipping textures in 
    materials, etc..  These assets are also automatically added as 
    model dependencies and copied to the target as relevant.
* Fixed a few places where AssetKey.toString() was used where AssetKey.getName()
    is more appropriate.  Prior to this change, texture dependencies with
    non-standard texture key properties would fail to copy during conversion
    because "myTexture.png (flipped)" is not a real file.
* Modified the ModelInfo "model" script API to allow easily adding new
    dependencies that will be copied during conversion.     
* Added Convert.addModelProcessor() to allow embedding application to
    add custom model processors.
* Added a "log" binding for scripts that logs to their script name appended
    to "script.".    
* Added ModelScript.set/getBinding for setting script binding variables
    from embedding applications.
* Made AssetReader reusable by exposing AssetReader.setAssetRoot() method. 
    Convert now uses the same AssetReader and AssetManager and will just reset
    the asset root path when required instead of creating a new one. This fixes
    a memory leak issue that was happening because of native memory allocated
    with previous asset manager instances was not being released properly for
    some reason and was leading to an OutOfMemoryError in embedding applications.

Version 1.3.0 (latest)
--------------
* Upgraded gradle to 7.4.2 and published to maven central.
* Modified BuildInfo to load a jmec.build.date properties file in addition
    to the normal git.properties.  Newer versions of the git properties plugin
    seem to no longer provide a build.time.


Version 1.2.0
--------------
* Fixed AssedReader to use canonical path instead of absolute path
    because sometimes paths weren't fully resolved and it confused
    the 'localized path' detection.
* Modified Convert to keep a list of ModelScripts instead of just
    script names.  Makes it easier to manage scripts in embedded
    applications.
* Modified ModelScript to be able to take the loaded script String
    on the constructor.
* Modified ModelScript so that it can return its script name.
* Added support for extracting subgraphs into separate j3o files
    linked into the main model with an AssetLinkNode.
    see: ModelInfo.extractSubmodel()
* Fixed an issue where the custom extras loader was not being used
    for GLB files.
* JmecNode for attaching an auto-updating JmeConverted asset to your
    scene that live-updates when the source model changes.


Version 1.1.1
--------------
* Modified to default -sourceRoot to the current directory if not
    specified.
* Fixed an issue saving J3o files that had GLTF imported user-data
    that was not strings.  During import, these are now specifically
    converted to Double or are treated as String if they are nested
    in such a way that JME does not support.


Version 1.1.0
--------------
* Added support for GLTF extensions as user-added data on the
    Spatial.  Includes support for all JSON primitives as well
    as Lists and Maps.
* Added a 'u' option to the -probe to show the user-added data
    of a converted model.


Version 1.0.0
--------------
* Initial release, includes:
    * asset copying and rehoming
    * model script processors for groovy, javascript, etc.
    * model probing options
    * optional material generation
